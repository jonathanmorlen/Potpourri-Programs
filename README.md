# Potpourri-Programs
Random programs that aren't a full project, similar to programming exercises

**Python**
- [Ackermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function): Computes the value of A(m, n) where A( ) is the Ackermann function. Prints the value and the time it took to compute.
             
- [A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm): OOP implementation of the A* algorithm. Computes the shortest distance from a starting coordinate to an ending coordinate in a rectangular grid of 1's and 0's, where a 0 is traversable and a 1 is not. Prints the grid with the solution path as x's, the coordinates of the path elements, and the length of the path.

- [Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture): Finds the longest progression of the Collatz Sequence of integers 1 to n. Prints the starting number of the longest progression, the sequence length, and the time it took to compute.

- Make Change: Given an amount of change 1 to 99 cents, computes the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount of change out of standard US coins (quarter, dime, nickel, penny). Prints the number of coins needed to make the amount of change.

- [Orthogonal Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)): 
Takes a vector and a subspace as input, computes the orthogonal projection of the vector onto the subspace using orthogonal projection. Prints the projection vector.
